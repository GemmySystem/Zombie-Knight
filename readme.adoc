= Zombie Knight

An arcade-style platformer game demo made in Ren'Py using Creator Defined Displayables. It was originally coded for
Pygame and then I ported it to Ren'Py, converting everything needed to make it function on Ren'Py's engine.


== How to Play

In Zombie Knight, you are a brave knight facing down hordes of neverending zombies. Each night that you survive, another
round passes and more zombies appear, faster than before. Your goal is to shoot them with your sword's beam and stomp on
them before they can reanimate. Killing a zombie will cause a ruby to appear from the Ruby Maker at the top of the
screen. Collect these to gain points and restore health. If a zombie collects one, instead, a new zombie is instantly
created. There are also portals that you, the zombies, and the rubies can use to transport to other portals, from
green-to-green and purple-to-purple. You only need to survive thirty seconds each round but lose all of your health and
it's game over. Can you reach an all-new high score?
